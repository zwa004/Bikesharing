# Analysis

## Purpose
The purpose of this analysis is to identify trends in use of citibike in New York City 

## Results
### Duration of Rides
![Checkout Times by Users](https://github.com/zwa004/Bikesharing/blob/main/Story%20(1).png)
Very few users use citibike longer than 60 minutes while a large majority of those users under 60 minutes ride less than 30 minutes. 

### Peak Hours

Males and females are direclty related in terms of use any given day of the week. 

### Subscriber vs Customer by Gender
![](https://github.com/zwa004/Bikesharing/blob/main/Story%20(6).png)
Males strongly prefer to subscribe to citibike (ie use citibike more frequently than females).

### Data Outliers
![](https://github.com/zwa004/Bikesharing/blob/main/Story%20(7).png)
There appear to be outliers in the data that disproportionately skew analyses. There are a large number of unknown genders and ride counts that are over 100 years old.

### Summary 
In general, cictibike has a larger base of users who are male than are female. The company would stand to increase prices for late morning and early evening rides for males while advertising more to females in order to increase user counts and average value of riders. That said, citibike would get valuable insight by comparing average value of ride at peak times of day (considering bikes that are in repair due to heavy use). The company would also benefit by examining the average lifespan of a given bike vs male/female usage. The company would also benefit from funneling down gender responses on their intake forms to eliminate "unknown" values in data.
