# Analysis

## Purpose
The purpose of this analysis is to identify trends in use of citibike in New York City 

## Results
### Duration of Rides
Very few users use citibike longer than 60 minutes while a large majority of those users under 60 minutes ride less than 30 minutes. 

### Peak Hours 
Peak weekday hours are from 6am to 9am and 4pm to 7pm while weekend useage is higher between 9am and 6pm.

### Gender Split
Over 50% of users are male.

### Duration of Use by Gender.
No more than 9 thousand females use citibike for any duration of time. The majority of women use citibike for 10 to 30 minutes

### Gender Use by Day
Males and females are direclty related in terms of use any given day of the week. 

### Subscriber vs Customer by Gender
Males strongly prefer to subscribe to citibike (ie use citibike more frequently than females).

### Data Outliers
There appear to be outliers in the data that disproportionately skew analyses. There are a large number of unknown genders and ride counts that are over 100 years old.

### Summary 
In general, cictibike has a larger base of users who are male than are female. The company would stand to increase prices for late morning and early evening rides for males while advertising more to females in order to increase user counts and average value of riders. That said, citibike would get valuable insight by comparing average value of ride at peak times of day (considering bikes that are in repair due to heavy use). The company would also benefit by examining the average lifespan of a given bike vs male/female usage. The company would also benefit from funneling down gender responses on their intake forms to eliminate "unknown" values in data.
